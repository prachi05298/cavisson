I looked at a lot of different units and ultimately it came down to a dice roll and I got this one from GE. I live in Phoenix and it can get pretty hot and muggy here in the summer. Currently in the high 90's and 20% humidity. Brought the unit home and set it up with the window install. It doesn't take a lot of time to set up and thankfully the casters are pre installed. IMO the instructions do not provide enough detail on installing the exhaust hose and its flanges (see pix). The square flange that attaches to the unit is keyed to only install one of 4 possible ways, there is no mention of this in the instructions. Its easier to install the hose to the flanges first, you can reach into the flange and pull the hose rather than pushing as instructed in the directions. After running on high cool for about 5 min I had 50 degree air coming out of the unit. it cooled the room fine and cycled off and on set at 73 degrees. I noticed the exhaust hose gets hot (I measured 120 degrees) so a lot of heat leakage back into the room. Once it have it run in for a few days, I'm going to move it to a more semi permanent location and wrap the exhaust hose with duct insulation. I have this unit and an air scrubber running in the room and I don't think its too loud, I measured 65 to 70 dB. So far so good and now I get to put my evap cooler back in the garage!","Title":"Feelin hot, hot, hot","UserNickname":"NationofFred","SecondaryRatings":{},"ContextDataValues":{},"Videos":[],"IsSyndicated":false,"SecondaryRatingsOrder":[],"RatingRange":5,"IsLowesLoopBadge":false,"IsRecievedProductForFree":false},{"Id":"232808860","SourceClient":"ge_appliances","ProductId":"5000143961","ContentLocale":"en_US","IsFeatured":false,"TotalInappropriateFeedbackCount":0,"IsSyndicated":true,"SyndicationSource":{"ClientId":null,"LogoImageUrl":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86YXR0cmlidXRpb25sb2dvMg/48dfbc86-02f5-4858-a03f-9ae256218181","ContentLink":"https://www.geappliances.com/appliance/GE-6-100-BTU-Portable-Air-Conditioner-with-Dehumidifier-and-Remote-White-APFD06JASW","Name":"geappliances.com"},"TotalClientResponseCount":0,"TotalCommentCount":0,"Photos":[{"Sizes":{"normal":{"Id":"normal","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/80a76b2e-e71e-5e63-9cf0-7db8e6ade8e2"},"thumbnail":{"Id":"thumbnail","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/78eb1652-c5a2-57be-bf5e-e05181cd0e19"},"large":{"Id":"large","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/33d950e5-0b93-5dfd-8100-2985a2a6fc13"}},"Id":"9308122","SizesOrder":["normal","thumbnail","large"],"Caption":null},{"Sizes":{"normal":{"Id":"normal","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/05fd749d-0def-5085-b793-8a798a2c0adb"},"thumbnail":{"Id":"thumbnail","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/1180ec28-5692-5322-875d-1094dc139c5a"},"large":{"Id":"large","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/fe6bd40d-1edc-516f-a13a-ed8cd7a79f18"}},"Id":"9308123","SizesOrder":["normal","thumbnail","large"],"Caption":null},{"Sizes":{"normal":{"Id":"normal","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/baa535ea-609d-516b-bfe8-cd7fd5cd1a7c"},"thumbnail":{"Id":"thumbnail","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/d6bf2c25-9106-5e25-b9f2-9f32ef9c119e"},"large":{"Id":"large","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/a27c2075-92c1-5742-b8d0-670a4320d342"}},"Id":"9308124","SizesOrder":["normal","thumbnail","large"],"Caption":null},{"Sizes":{"normal":{"Id":"normal","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/5c6e9592-2a53-5b66-964b-9db568466099"},"thumbnail":{"Id":"thumbnail","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/338337f8-f1f6-5d2b-a2db-b2faa356fa10"},"large":{"Id":"large","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/5a4d1b7a-3f55-5b17-96ab-dd0d941d6ebc"}},"Id":"9308125","SizesOrder":["normal","thumbnail","large"],"Caption":null},{"Sizes":{"normal":{"Id":"normal","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/e3c5d4e0-a6d3-5b61-ad51-b9b8280a6d23"},"thumbnail":{"Id":"thumbnail","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/30e9049f-92ba-5b42-8d5f-f92d4bf5ecf8"},"large":{"Id":"large","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/17637a5c-f884-5b2c-89d8-8ef345f5e3cc"}},"Id":"9308126","SizesOrder":["normal","thumbnail","large"],"Caption":null},{"Sizes":{"normal":{"Id":"normal","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/608dccb2-7a5e-5eb9-be37-1c82e037e016"},"thumbnail":{"Id":"thumbnail","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/51d3eae6-2a40-522a-999a-6d9ace69b4d2"},"large":{"Id":"large","Url":"https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86Z2VfYXBwbGlhbmNlcw/aefc9ea6-d999-532f-8bff-5e550a0f2c82"}},"Id":"9308127","SizesOrder":["normal","thumbnail","large"],"Caption":null}],"Rating":5,"IsRatingsOnly":false,"IsRecommended":true,"SubmissionTime":"2021-07-21T22:46:41.000+00:00","ReviewText":"This was an easy set up from start to finish.

While it is noisier than other portable AC units i've used, and the installation materials are also sub-par in comparison, it cools better and more efficiently than any other unit i've purchased.  Four stars overall, and five stars for cooling.  This review is for the GE 8000/6100 BTU Unit rated for 250 sq ft.  \n\nWe live in Florida, and use portable units as emergency hurricane backups and to augment our central AC from mid-June through mid-September.  We've used several portable AC units in the past from two different brands, each rated at 400 sq. ft.  This unit matches their cooling power, despite carrying a much lower power rating and capacity.  It also uses roughly 300 watts less energy, helping us save a bit on our electric bill.  Like the other units, water will accumulate quickly in a humid environment, so we elevate them and use drain hoses and buckets, as shown in the photos.  While some scoff at water accumulation, this is Florida--we want our units to eliminate humidity!  A 4-5 gallon bucket with hoses is sufficient to handle drainage, and should be checked every 8 hours.  This unit is excellent at knocking down humidity in your enclosure, typically reducing our indoor humidity by 15-20%.  \n\nEvery portable AC unit carries drawbacks, and despite this unit's cooling prowess, there are some oddities.  Most importantly, it is noticeably louder than others we've previously used.  The sound is comparable to the elongated window ACs in hotels during the 1990s and 2000s.  It doesn't bother us, but if you're a light sleeper, or if this is for a child's bedroom, it could be problematic.  Next, in comparison to others we've used, the additional materials are substandard.  The exhaust hose is thinner, and the included insulation was literally wrapped into a ball and tied--rendering it useless.  If you purchase this unit, do yourself the favor and buy your own insulation package as well.  It also did not include any drainage hoses in the package, so the ones you see in the photos are extras I had laying around.  You'll have to retrofit and cut your own otherwise.  Finally--and this is unexplainable--if we set the temperature at its lowest setting of 61 degrees, our condenser makes a rattling sound.  Set to 62 degrees or higher?  No rattling at all.  This has held steady for several weeks, so perhaps its a software bug?  \n\nDespite the mild drawbacks, i'm more impressed with this GE unit than any other ive purchased before. When it comes time to replace our larger units, i'll be looking at a larger GE one--and reusing some of our prior setup materials.  The cooling and efficiency is too impressive to purchase anything else.","Title":"Excellent Cooling and Efficiency","UserNickname":"BeachBoy","SecondaryRatings":{},"ClientResponses":[],"ContextDataValues":{},"Videos":[],"IsSyndicated":false,"SecondaryRatingsOrder":[],"RatingRange":5,"IsLowesLoopBadge":false,"IsRecievedProductForFree":false},{"Id":"206151006","SourceClient":"lowes","ProductId":"5000143961","ClientResponses":[{"Department":"GE Answers","Response":"\nHi there - Thanks for taking the time to write a review.

Extracts an amazing amount of water from the atmosphere. But the installation is not the best for louvered windows. I’ve had to use duct tape to seal off spaces the mounting kit pieces and foam strips would not seal. The exhaust hose wants to retract and pull out of the exhaust nozzle and exhaust bracket that fits directly onto the standup unit. So you have to be careful if you move the unit around. When not in use I push it out of the way, tight to the wall which restricts the airflow into the hose. I pull the unit out from the wall when in use. A 15 amp circuit is minimum for this unit. Anything much more than just the AC on the circuit will trip the breaker. Pay attention to the “Drainage Instructions” as they are 100% accurate. If you are in a humid climate (I’m in Maui) this unit will extract a LOT of water from the atmosphere.  All that said, the unit (so far) meets my cooling expectations which is 10 degrees lower than outside temp. That is, the 80 degree range inside when it gets hot (average temps in the 90’s) outside. I only gave it a three star rating as it’s only been in service every day for a week and we haven’t hit our hottest temps yet. It is not an industrial strength AC unit so expectations should be in line with what it can do, not what it can’t.","Title":"Works OK.
